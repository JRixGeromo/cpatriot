            Thank you for submitting your answers to our polling question on the issue of Photo ID Voting Requirements.
            <br><br>
            And, as a thank you for completing our poll question, we are sending you a FREE copy of our latest guide from FCPAC's Policy Team: <b>Tongues Cut Out: How The Left Is Silencing Conservatives And Ending Your Right To Free Speech</b>
            <br><br>
            You should receive it in your inbox shortly. 
            <br><br>
            (If you don’t receive it in your inbox, <b>please check your spam folder</b>. We have been experiencing a high volume of censorship issues lately from Big Tech corporations for our conservative values.)
            <br><br>
            And because you're an informed and engaged patriot, we'd like to ask you to consider one more thing before you go…
            <br><br>
            We're on a mission to increase public confidence in the election process. 
            <br><br>
            Currently, 35 states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls.
            <br><br>
            Conservatives insist it's a common-sense measure to cut down on the possibility of voter fraud. But Liberals push back, saying that voter ID laws tend to disenfranchise minority voters at a far higher rate than white ones.
            <br><br>
            We all want free and fair elections. Every eligible American wants to – and should – have a say in deciding which people and policies will determine the future of our families, community, and country.
            <br><br>
            Will you make a gift today to help us increase public confidence in the election process and protect free and fair elections?
            <br><br>
            When you do, you will help us:
            <ul>
              <li class="v-space">Rally millions of eligible voters to fight back against voter fraud and those who oppose photo ID requirements.</li>
              <li class="v-space">Run compelling digital ads and newsletters that inform, educate, and provide sound solutions to those highly impacted by voter fraud and unfair voting practices.</li>
              <li class="v-space">Leverage our FCPAC's Policy Team to conduct intensive research and lobbying efforts to those in Congress to stop “woke” and “unconstitutional” liberal agendas before they are enacted.</li>
            </ul>

              Fellow Patriot,
              <br><br>
              THE FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA IS ON THE LINE.
              <br><br>
              Just look at some of the issues we currently face: 
              <ul>
                <li>rising inflation…</li>
                <li>unsecured borders…</li>
                <li>out-of-control gas prices...</li>
                <li>an increase in crime nationwide...</li>
                <li>gun rights under constant threat...</li>
                <li>violent attacks on law enforcement…</li>
                <li>parental rights under constant assault…</li>
                <li>massive censorship of conservative voices…</li>
                <li>an opioid epidemic that's sweeping the country…</li>
                <li>the mobilization of the FBI used as a partisan Gestapo…</li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>
              In just a few short years, the wealthiest, most powerful, most influential nation in human history has become dangerously radicalized, divided, and weak.
              <br><br>
              At the Family Conservation PAC, we're doing more than just helping citizens of this great nation learn the Constitutional principles of a free society...
              <br><br>
              We're helping them understand that American citizenship means <b>TAKING ACTION.</b>
              <br><br>
              We want to inspire Americans to join the fight to make a difference during this <b>"make-or-break"</b> time for our country.
              <br><br>
              Answer this question and be as honest as possible…
              <br><br>
              <b>Are you better off NOW than you were two years ago?</b>
              <br><br>
              Unfortunately, this historic and exceptional country is being destroyed from the very top.
              <br><br>
              Make no mistake about it…there's no sitting on the sidelines. If we’re going to survive another two years of the Biden regime’s leftist agendas, we must take action to change the direction of our country.
              <br><br>
              If you agree, I hope you will join us as our newest supporter. 
              <br><br>
              Your gift to the Family Conservation PAC today will help prepare true patriotic citizens to enter the arena and fight the Far-Left agendas that are currently destroying our country.
              <br><br>
              <b>Will YOU get in the arena and fight to save our Republic?</b>
              <br><br>
